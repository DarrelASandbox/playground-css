Shadows are commonly used in web design to create an elevation effect. They add depth and dimension to flat elements by mimicking the way light falls on objects, which helps users distinguish between layers of content. This effect improves the visual hierarchy, making it easier for users to focus on interactive elements like buttons, cards, or modals.

In modern web design, **box-shadow** in CSS is frequently used for this purpose. Here are some tips on using shadows effectively:

1. **Subtlety**: Keep shadows soft and subtle to avoid overwhelming the design. Sharp, dark shadows can look unnatural.
2. **Direction and Light Source**: Shadows should be consistent with a light source in your design. Commonly, light is imagined from the top left or center.
3. **Layering and Elevation**: The closer an element is meant to feel to the user, the stronger the shadow (more offset and blur radius).

4. **Material Design**: Googleâ€™s Material Design system popularized the concept of elevation using shadows, with defined elevation levels for components based on their hierarchy.
